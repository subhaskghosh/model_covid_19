Here, we use observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model, and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. We estimate that 86\% of all infections were undocumented [95\% credible interval (CI): 82{\textendash}90\%] before the 23 January 2020 travel restrictions. The transmission rate of undocumented infections per person was 55\% the transmission rate of documented infections (95\% CI: 46{\textendash}62\%), yet, because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source of 79\% of the documented cases. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate that containment of this virus will be particularly challenging.},

	abstract = {A novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in China in December, 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period, which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Here, we use data from public reports of 101 confirmed cases in 38 provinces, regions, and countries outside of Wuhan (Hubei province, China) with identifiable exposure windows and known dates of symptom onset to estimate the incubation period of 2019-nCoV. We estimate the median incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be 5.2 days (95\% CI 4.4-6.0), and 97.5\% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 10.5 days (95\% CI: 7.3, 15.3) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 64 out of every 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Whether this risk is acceptable depends on the underlying risk of infection and consequences of missed cases. The estimates presented here can be used to inform policy in multiple contexts based on these judgments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was provided for this work.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

It is shown that, if R0<1, then the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable; whereas if R0>1, then it is unstable. Thus, R0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector–host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control."

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = { As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds, public health response is reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as transmission potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely used modelling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far overestimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase of 2014 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in estimates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed. We conclude with a short list of principles to guide the modelling response to future infectious disease outbreaks. }

Herein, we propose a mathematical model to analyzes this epidemic, based on a dynamic mechanism that incorporating the intrinsic impact of hidden la- tent and infectious cases on the entire process of transmission. Meanwhile, this model is validated by data correlation analysis, predicting the recent public data, and back- tracking, as well as sensitivity analysis. The dynamical model reveals the impact of various measures on the key parameters of the epidemic. According to the public data of NHCs from 01/20 to 02/09, we predict the epidemic peak and possible end time for 5 different regions. The epidemic in Beijing and Shanghai, Mainland/Hubei and Hubei/Wuhan, are expected to end before the end of February, and before mid- March respectively. The model indicates that, the outbreak in Wuhan is predicted to be ended in the early April. As a result, more effective policies and more efforts on clinical research are demanded. Moreover, through the backtracking simulation, we infer that the outbreak of the epidemic in Mainland/Hubei, Hubei/Wuhan, and Wuhan can be dated back to the end of December 2019 or the beginning of January 2020.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNational Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 21877070, 11801020) and the Fundamental Research Funding of Beijing University of Technology (006000546318505, 006000546319509, 006000546319526)Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

We examine mathematically the impact of isolation and quarantine on the control of SARS during the outbreaks in Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing using a deterministic model that closely mimics the data for cumulative infected cases and SARS–related deaths in the first three regions but not in Beijing until mid–April, when China started to report data more accurately. The results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and diseased individuals by isolating the latter is a critically important strategy that can control SARS outbreaks with or without quarantine. An optimal isolation programme entails timely implementation under stringent hygienic precautions defined by a critical threshold value. Values below this threshold lead to control, but those above are associated with the incidence of new community outbreaks or nosocomial infections, a known cause for the spread of SARS in each region. Allocation of resources to implement optimal isolation is more effective than to implement sub–optimal isolation and quarantine together. A community–wide eradication of SARS is feasible if optimal isolation is combined with a highly effective screening programme at the points of entry. }

	abstract = {Background: World Health organization declared Covid-19 as an outbreak, hence preventive measure like lockdown should be taken to control the spread of infection. This study offers an exhaustive analysis of the reproductive number (R0) in India with major intervention for COVID-19 outbreaks and analysed the lockdown effects on the Covid-19. Methodology: Covid-19 data extracted from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Then, a novel method implemented in the incidence and Optimum function in desolve package to the data of cumulative daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating the reproduction number in the R software. Result: Analysis has been seen that the lockdown was really quite as effective, India has already shown a major steady decline. The growth rate has fluctuated about 20 percent with trend line projections in various lockdown. A comparative analysis gives an idea of decline in value of R0 from 1.73 to 1.08. Annotation plot showing the predicted R0 values based on previous lockdown in month of June and July. Conclusion: Without lockdown, the growth might not have been contained in India and may have gone into the exponential zone. We show that, the lockdown in India was fairly successful. The effect partial lifting of the lockdown (unlock) is also seen in the results, in terms of increment in R0 values. Hence this study provides a platform for policy makers and government authorities for implementing the strategies to prevent the spread of infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNAAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Not ApplicableAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = "Background
	Since the onset of the COVID-19 in China, forecasting and projections of the epidemic based on epidemiological models have been in the centre stage. Researchers have used various models to predict the maximum extent of the number of cases and the time of peak. This yielded varying numbers. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (R) for COVID-19 over time using incident number of cases that are reported by the government.
	Methods
	Exponential Growth method to estimate basic reproduction rate R0, and Time dependent method to calculate the effective reproduction number (dynamic) were used. “R0” package in R software was used to estimate these statistics.
	Results
	The basic reproduction number (R0) for India was estimated at 1.379 (95% CI: 1.375, 1.384). This was 1.450 (1.441, 1.460) for Maharashtra, 1.444 (1.430, 1.460) for Gujarat, 1.297 (1.284, 1.310) for Delhi and 1.405 (1.389, 1.421) for Tamil Nadu. In India, the R at the first week from March 2–8, 2020 was 3.2. It remained around 2 units for three weeks, from March 9–29, 2020. After March 2020, it started declining and reached around 1.3 in the following week suggesting a stabilisation of the transmissibility rate.
	Conclusion
	The study estimated a baseline R0 of 1.379 for India. It also showed that the R was getting stabilised from first week of April (with an average R of 1.29), despite the increase in March. This suggested that in due course there will be a reversal of epidemic. However, these analyses should be revised periodically."

	abstract={The clinical features and immune responses of asymptomatic individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been well described. We studied 37 asymptomatic individuals in the Wanzhou District who were diagnosed with RT--PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections but without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 d and during hospitalization. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated Wanzhou People's Hospital for centralized isolation in accordance with policy1. The median duration of viral shedding in the asymptomatic group was 19 d (interquartile range (IQR), 15--26 d). The asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than the symptomatic group (log-rank P{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.028). The virus-specific IgG levels in the asymptomatic group (median S/CO, 3.4; IQR, 1.6--10.7) were significantly lower (P{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.005) relative to the symptomatic group (median S/CO, 20.5; IQR, 5.8--38.2) in the acute phase. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3{\%} (28/30) and 81.1{\%} (30/37) had reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively, during the early convalescent phase, as compared to 96.8{\%} (30/31) and 62.2{\%} (23/37) of symptomatic patients. Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative and 12.9{\%} of the symptomatic group became negative for IgG in the early convalescent phase. In addition, asymptomatic individuals exhibited lower levels of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that asymptomatic individuals had a weaker immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels in the early convalescent phase might have implications for immunity strategy and serological surveys.},
